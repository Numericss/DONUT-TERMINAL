# Description
3D ASCII donut using Python with Pygame
The 3D Donut Terminal ASCII is created using a combination of trigonometry, sine and cosine functions to calculate the positions of the individual ASCII characters, which are then colored and displayed in the terminal to create a smooth animation. This project is suitable for various platforms such as Linux, macOS, and Windows.
This code is inspired by Andy Sloane blog post where he explained how he wrote C code for rotating ASCII donut.
